## *2. Description*

Feeding Hands is a web platform that tackles two major challenges in India: urban food waste and farmer financial distress.

*What it does:*
It connects businesses with surplus food—like hotels and event managers—to NGOs who can distribute it to those in need. Simultaneously, it provides farmers with a dashboard displaying real-time market prices and AI-powered forecasts predicting which crops will be in high demand.

*Why it matters:*
By diverting surplus food to the hungry, it reduces waste and creates a cleaner, more equitable society. Farmers gain access to critical data, helping them get fair prices and make smarter decisions. This holistic solution generates social, environmental, and economic impact.
